# Upgrading X-Infrastructure Optimizer Controllers

> **Note:**
>
> You should be :

| Who? | On which system?  | In which directory?             |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| root | X-Infrastructure Optimizer controller | /nfs-apps/exostellar/onboarding |

> **Reminder:** `/nfs-apps` is a stand-in for the path to your remote folder

To update X-Infrastructure Optimizer with a new or updated onboarding tarball, we recommend starting the onboarding process from scratch. It is, however, also possible to upgrade "in place." Either way, we'll start with a backup step and move to the upgrade procedures once that's accomplished.
